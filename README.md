This is a small script for generating a set of booklets for the Lakeland
Heritage Project from the AirTable database that we are using to collect
metadata for the project. The booklets were used to record information about the
photos from community members. You can see the generated books in the books
directory.

To run books.py, you'll need to make sure to set AIRTABLE_KEY in your
environment. Also you'll need a working pdflatex from [TeX].
